# parser-prism

This gem provides a new backend for the [whitequark/parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser) gem's syntax tree that uses the [prism](https://github.com/ruby/prism) parser.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "parser-prism"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install parser-prism

## Usage

The `parser` gem provides multiple parsers to support different versions of the Ruby grammar. This includes all of the Ruby versions going back to 1.8, as well as third-party parsers like MacRuby and RubyMotion. The `parser-prism` gem provides another parser that uses the `prism` parser to build the syntax tree.

You can use the `prism` parser like you would any other. After requiring the parser, you should be able to call any of the regular `Parser::Base` APIs that you would normally use.

```ruby
require "parser/prism"

Parser::Prism.parse_file("path/to/file.rb")
```

### RuboCop

To run RuboCop using the `parser-prism` gem as the parser, you will need to require the `parser/prism/rubocop` file. This file injects `prism` into the known options for both `rubocop` and `rubocop-ast`, such that you can specify it in your `.rubocop.yml` file. Unfortunately `rubocop` doesn't support any direct way to do this, so we have to get a bit hacky.

First, set the `TargetRubyVersion` in your RuboCop configuration file to `80_82_73_83_77.33`. This is the version of Ruby that `prism` reports itself as. (The leading numbers are the ASCII values for `PRISM`.)

```yaml
AllCops:
  TargetRubyVersion: 80_82_73_83_77.33
```

Now when you run `rubocop` you will need to require the `parser/prism/rubocop` file before executing so that it can inject the `prism` parser into the known options.

```
bundle exec ruby -rparser/prism/rubocop $(bundle exec which rubocop)
```

This should run RuboCop using the `prism` parser.

## Benchmarks

As a whole, this parser should be significantly faster than the `parser` gem. The `bin/bench` script in this repository compares the performance of `Parser::CurrentRuby` and `Parser::Prism`. Running against a large file like `lib/parser/prism/compiler.rb` yields:

```
Warming up --------------------------------------
 Parser::CurrentRuby     1.000  i/100ms
       Parser::Prism     6.000  i/100ms
Calculating -------------------------------------
 Parser::CurrentRuby     16.642  (± 0.0%) i/s -     84.000  in   5.052021s
       Parser::Prism     64.951  (± 3.1%) i/s -    330.000  in   5.088147s

Comparison:
       Parser::Prism:       65.0 i/s
 Parser::CurrentRuby:       16.6 i/s - 3.90x  slower
```

When running with `--yjit`, the comparison is even more stark:

```
Warming up --------------------------------------
 Parser::CurrentRuby     1.000  i/100ms
       Parser::Prism     9.000  i/100ms
Calculating -------------------------------------
 Parser::CurrentRuby     20.062  (± 0.0%) i/s -    101.000  in   5.034389s
       Parser::Prism    112.823  (± 9.7%) i/s -    558.000  in   5.009460s

Comparison:
       Parser::Prism:      112.8 i/s
 Parser::CurrentRuby:       20.1 i/s - 5.62x  slower
```

These benchmarks were run on a single laptop without a lot of control for other processes, so take them with a grain of salt.

## Development

Run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests. This runs tests exported from the `parser` gem into their own fixture files.
